Vans Vans Unisex Classic Slipon Skate Shoe Black From walmart.com
Let me read you in on something, when you are thrashing, you are traveling through the frontal plane aka lateral plane. The shoe is also designed and made with a rubber sole so that you can wear it for maximum comfort. When vans opened their doors in 1966 (van doren back then), they weren’t really meant for skateboarding. I tried adidas busenitz vulc ii skate shoes and have felt far more comfort and seen them hold up way better.

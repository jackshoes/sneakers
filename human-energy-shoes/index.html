Inertial forces have been used for energy generation either inside shoes [21], within the shoe sole [6, 22], [23] that harvest energy from footfalls or mobile phone chargers integrated in backpacks[24] or phones [25]. Human energy harvesting is a promising power source for wearable devices. From sneakers, formal shoes and boots, as well as more our iconic models. Capturing electricity with a shoe.

<p>There may be potential to harvest energy from human gait without increasing metabolic cost with sliding shoes that could increase stride length. The mechanical energy dissipated in shoes can even power a computer, serving as an attractive energy source for wearable. The piezoelectric material is a smart material which generates electrical charges under strain changes when subjected to pressure, and electrodes can collect electrical charges to produce electrical current. Inertial forces have been used for energy generation either inside shoes [21], within the shoe sole [6, 22], [23] that harvest energy from footfalls or mobile phone chargers integrated in backpacks[24] or phones [25].

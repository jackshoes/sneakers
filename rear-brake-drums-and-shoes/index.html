REAR BRAKE DRUMS&#43;SHOES Fits Toyota Hilux 2WD RN41 2.0L From ebay.com.au
If your brakes are squealing or aren’t working as effectively, it’s time to change your rear brake shoes. Having the shoes properly seated in the drums would also increase braking because right now i have a fraction of the total friction surface area actually in contact with the drum. Generally, the front brakes will be pads and rotors, while the back will be drums and shoes. The service manual says the primary (bigger) brake shoe goes toward the front, but the current set up on the old brakes has them toward the rear.

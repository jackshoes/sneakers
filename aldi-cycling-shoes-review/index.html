<p>With the summer fast disappearing i knew i wouldn’t be able to wear my shorts for much longer and had been looking at winter cycling clothes but with cycling gear being quite expensive looking was as far as it went! On the plus side, your £7.99 buys a simple polyester/elastane softshell. The soles are lethal when wet… complete waste of money. Switch up your cycling gear. Grab an Aldi Specialbuys cycling bargain on 28th September.</p>

<p>The other shoe did exactly the same, shortly after i’d fixed the first one with a shimano shoe insert/cleat plate. With the summer fast disappearing i knew i wouldn’t be able to wear my shorts for much longer and had been looking at winter cycling clothes but with cycling gear being quite expensive looking was as far as it went! While this is one of the more expensive products aldi sells, it’s on the cheaper end for an indoor bike with this set of features. Casual in this instance suggests more than just occasional scoots down to the pub; Aldi's Cycling Range Launches TOMORROW 24th Sept 2015.</p>

<p>The right shoes are a critical part of your bike touring kit, but what shoes are right for you? Bargain supermarket aldi has launched a cycling range in response to the cycling boom caused by the lockdown. We take a closer look at the supermarket’s fitness clothing. But after trialling it, we’ve discovered it’s better than the price would suggest. Aldi Australia offers cycling specials BikeRadar.</p>
<h3 id="we-take-a-closer-look-at-the-supermarkets-fitness-clothing">We Take A Closer Look At The Supermarket’s Fitness Clothing.</h3><p>So once again aldi have dome themselves proud with a good range of winter cycling clothes. This review only covers a bit of the clothing range (they do gloves, shoe covers, jackets and so on). That will depend on where you’re riding, the conditions you expect to encounter, your personal preference, and your budget! Whether you want shoes just for riding or to double up as ride shoes and street shoes,.</p>

I do a lot of cycling so was thrilled to be asked to review some cycling clothes from aldi’s specialbuys. They're fine for shorter rides both in terms of comfort and weatherproofing, but ultimately i found them a little disappointing. Flying off my foot and under a bus.</p>

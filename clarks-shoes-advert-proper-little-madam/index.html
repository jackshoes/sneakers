<p>The scariest one for me was the 'judderman' ad for metz. He was angular and spidery, just like the childcatcher from chitty chitty bang bang. There was a tv ad years ago. Does anyone else remember that clarks shoe advert from the 1970s, where a little girl exclaims, “my mum says i’m going to grow up to be a proper little madam!”?</p>

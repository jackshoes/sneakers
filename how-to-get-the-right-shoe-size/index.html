How to Choose the Right Running Shoe for You Steward From stewardtoday.com
Compare your foot measurements to the measurements on our shoe length chart to find the number that corresponds to your shoe length. Don&#39;t select shoes by the size marked inside the shoe but by how the shoe fits your foot. Keep in mind that your longest toe isn’t necessarily your big toe. Never buy shoes that are too small and think they’ll be better when you break them in.

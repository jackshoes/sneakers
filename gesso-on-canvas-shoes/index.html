Canvas shoes, and canvas you can buy in an art store are different. White house paint with glue (exterior glue if it for outside) would probably work better and be less expensive. The gesso layer ensures that oil paint won’t come directly in contact with the canvas, which would cause decay. Hand painted shoes are not only artwork, but also of practical use.

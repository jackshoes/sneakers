Does My Puppy Need Snow Boots? PetPlace From petplace.com
While dog boots aren’t always necessary to keep paws safe, there may be times, places, and situations in which dog shoes are necessary to protect fido’s paws, such as in extreme hot or snowy weather, when traversing rough terrain, or to protect your dog from allergies or when they have a cut paw, amongst others. Putting boots on biff before a winter walk will protect his paws by keeping ice and snow from building up on the bottoms of his feet and in between his toes. They also stop snow, ice, melting salt, and other debris from building up between your dog’s paw pads, which can cause painful cuts and sores. Nelson thinks that dogs and other animals may have a different circulatory process than humans.

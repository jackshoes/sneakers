Many hindus are unaware of the leather they wear. Leather shoes are seen as a vestige of british colonial rule, under which they were introduced as a requirement for indian school uniforms. Cowhide leather shoes are available in distinct models made of unique and authentic leather materials such as cow leather, sheep leather, and many more. In religiously diverse countries, leather vendors are typically careful to clarify the kinds of leather used in their products.

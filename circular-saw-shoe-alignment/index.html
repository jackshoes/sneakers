Shop DEWALT 18volt 61/2in Cordless Circular Saw with From lowes.com
Some saws contain notches on the shoe that can help you align the saw with the correct cutline for cutting at 90 degrees or at unique angles. My dcs575 has the alignment problem. Loosely install the four mounting screws on the front portion of the shoe. Second saw was 1/64 out, probably as good as i would find right out of the box.

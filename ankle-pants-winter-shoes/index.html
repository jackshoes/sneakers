Ladies Faux Fur Lace Up Womens Grip Sole Snow Winter Ankle From ebay.com
Ankle pants, too chilly here in winter to wear them, also my husband would make lots of comments, “aren’t your ankles cold? Long enough to cover most of the leg, yet short enough to flash a bit of ankle too. As seen on the model in lands’ end , a classic pump with a traditional vamp (not too high, not too much “toe cleavage) and pointed or almond toe is a great choice with such pants. I always say that if you wear long pants with your ankle boots, then you don’t really see them as much.

What’s a bug out bag? At night, we would take off our boots, and loosely put on a pair of trainers, so if attacked at night, we could “bug out” of the harbour area quickly and effectively without having to put boots on. In an emergency situation, only having to think about shoes, keys, and bags is a lot easier than thinking about everything else. Your bug out bag should include sanitation supplies like soaps, shampoos, wipes and hand sanitizers.

New Balance Kid&#39;s 624 V2 Running Shoe, Black, 3 M US From ebay.com
This is a nice looking shoe from pleaser. As with all pleaser shoes they run small so i always order a size larger than i do with other shoes, so this is something you have to keep in mind when ordering online and not able to try the shoe on. Don’t go higher than you can handle — you don’t want to look like a newborn giraffe trying to stand up. You may be late to work or a date the day you get your shoes delivered.

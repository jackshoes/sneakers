The 10 Best Sprint Spikes Available Now Complex From complex.com
My cardio is the best i&#39;ve ever been. You need a shoe that will aid you throughout the different phases of the sprint, which is digging at the start, accelerating and then maintaining your tempo and form before going onto a strong finish at the end of the race. I don&#39;t feel like running out of breath and i lost 17lbs/8kls so far which most likely helped improve my running. That’s why it’s essential you wear a shoe that is lightweight and provides the least amount of resistance.

Men&#39;s Merrell Moab 2 GORETEX® Half Sizes Approach Shoe From tiso.com
My personal opinion from experience/research/consulting with other climbers is that the best choice is running shoes. Like the hillsound trail crampon and the microspikes, it has an elastomer harness that works with a variety of shoes and foot shapes and sizes. Though not suited for climbing, they are useful for anyone who doesn’t like. The scarpa manta tech, scarpa ribelle and sportiva trango models are all popular choices.

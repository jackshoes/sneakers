How to tell if a shoe is too wide? Walk on Foam From walkonfoam.com
Shoes that are too narrow or too wide for your feet may lead to foot problems or you leaving them in the closet unworn. Suppose your shoe size is eight and your feet are 3.9 ”, which means your feet are wide. As for measurements, you should be able to fit the width of your thumb in between your toes and the tip of your shoe. If you have to curl your toes while walking to keep the shoes from slipping and sliding around, the shoes are definitely either too big or too wide.

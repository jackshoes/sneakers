<p>Another embodiment of the invention provides a drum brake backplate made from a constrained layer viscoelastic. Drum brakes to be specific are made out of many components such as brake drum, pistons, shoes, brake cylinder, and so on. When the brake pedal is pressed, these shoes are pushed outwards against the inner surface of the brake drum, generating friction and so slowing the car down. Drum brakes and brake shoes are parts of an older type of braking system and have become less common on modern vehicles. Drum Brake Shoes VB126, H304 110mm x 25mm (Pair). Essex.</p>

<p>In cars the parking brake can be the drum brake. When the driver applies the brake, a wheel cylinder in the drum brake system forces the brake shoe outward, against the inside of the drum. Brakes and rear brake shoes are something that are extremely important for your safety and should never be neglected. When a driver steps on the brake, the brake shoe is the mechanical part that he or she is ultimately controlling to bring the car to a stop.</p>

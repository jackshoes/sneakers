Yes, you can wash your athletic shoes in the washer From city-data.com
We&#39;ve found that cotton, canvas, polyester and nylon shoes (like runners and sneakers) have some capacity to be washed in a washing machine, while leather, suede and satin shoes require other cleaning methods. If they are leather laces, clean them using the same instructions as those for cleaning the leather shoes. Use a hard brush, or scrub harshly. Majority of our shoes unless they are suede or leather can be hand washed with a washcloth and soap and then air dryed or put into the washing machine on a gentle cycle and then air dried 🙂 please refer to the blog on what type of material works best with what cleaning method!
